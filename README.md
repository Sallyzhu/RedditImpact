GitHub Repository: Mental Health and COVID-19 on Reddit

This repository contains the code and data used for the paper "Understanding the Evolving Content and Emotions Associated with the Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health Support Groups on Reddit".

Data:
The dataset used in this study includes posts from the r/Depression and r/Anxiety subreddits between 2019 and 2022. The dataset comprises of 351,409 unique users and their posts. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, the original dataset is not publicly available. However, a subset of preprocessed data used in this study is included in the repository.

Code:
The code in this repository was written in Python 3. It includes several modules for data preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), statistical analysis, and data visualization.

Preprocessing:
The preprocessing module includes scripts to clean and transform the raw data into a format suitable for NLP and statistical analysis. The scripts remove stop words, non-alphabetic characters, and stem words to reduce the dimensionality of the data.

NLP:
The NLP module includes scripts to identify key terms associated with targeted themes within the dataset. The module uses topic modeling and Word2Vec embedding models to refine and expand upon these terms.

Statistical Analysis:
The statistical analysis module includes scripts to conduct time-to-event analysis, longitudinal content analysis, factor analysis, and regression analysis.

Data Visualization:
The data visualization module includes scripts to visualize the results of the statistical analysis using various types of plots, including heatmaps, bar charts, and line charts.

Conclusion:
This repository provides researchers and practitioners with a set of tools to analyze and understand the evolving content and emotions associated with the impact of COVID-19 on mental health support groups on Reddit. The code and data in this repository can be used to reproduce the results presented in the paper or to conduct further analysis.
